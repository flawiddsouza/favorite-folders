## [1.1.0] - 2021-09-26
### Changed
- Configuration 'favoriteFolders.baseFolders' is now machine specific. To prevent issues when using the extension on windows and then on wsl, as paths are different for windows and linux.
- Added a "open settings" button in the extension view to quickly open extension settings.
